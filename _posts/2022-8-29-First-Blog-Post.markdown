# Welcome to my new blog
<p>
I just created a new blog on my site to write about stuff that doesn't merit it's own page. I'll probably start writing
about cooking, growing plants and programming or whatever my new hobby happens to be at the moment. 
</p>
<p>
The blog is still under construction so it will be a bit crude looking for a while. I'll try to improve the look of 
the blog and add tags to filter posts by category.
