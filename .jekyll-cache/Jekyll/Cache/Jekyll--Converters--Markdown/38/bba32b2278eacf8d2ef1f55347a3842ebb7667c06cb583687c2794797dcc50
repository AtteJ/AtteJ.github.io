I built an abb and flow hydroponics system for chilies from storage boxes and an old aquarium pump. It has a 20 liter box for reservoir and a 10 liter box for flood tray. Ideally the containers should not be clear to limit algae growth in water but I haventâ€™t had any problems yet and I like to look at the inner workings.

The flood tray has a hole drilled for the silicone hose connected to the water pump. Instead of an overflow pipe I cut holes in the sides and glued some mesh over them with aquarium silicone. The pump has 300l/h capacity and currently pumps the fertilizer solution to the flood tray twice a day.

I sowed three types of chilies. Bolivian Rainbow(C. Annuum), Numex Twilight(C. Annuum) and Cabai Burung Ungu(C. Frutescens). Both of the annuums had 100% germination rate but neither of the frutescens seeds have germinated yet. They were under grow lights in about 27Â°C and high humidity and germinated in about two weeks.

After germination I moved the seedlings to rockwool and moved them to the ebb and flow system. They are under a 100w LED grow light with around 14 hours of light and two floods a day. They seem to grow quite well in this system.

While waiting for the seeds to germinate for the ebb and flow system I decided to try  a passive wicking hydroponics system. I cut a two liter bottle in half and turned the top upside down. I stuffed the bottleneck with cheesecloth and filled the top with perlite. I then took an orange habanero(C. Chinense) from the greenhouse, washed the compost from the roots and planted it in the perlite. Last step was to fill the bottom with fertilizer solution and then I put it under grow lights.
