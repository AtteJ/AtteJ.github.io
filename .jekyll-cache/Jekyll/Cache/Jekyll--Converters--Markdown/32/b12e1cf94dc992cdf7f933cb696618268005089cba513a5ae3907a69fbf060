I built an abb and flow hydroponics system for chilies from storage boxes and an old aquarium pump. It has a 20 liter box for reservoir and a 10 liter box for flood tray. Ideally the containers should not be clear to limit algae growth in water but I havent’t had any problems yet and I like to look at the inner workings.

The flood tray has a hole drilled for the silicone hose connected to the water pump. Instead of an overflow pipe I cut holes in the sides and glued some mesh over them with aquarium silicone. The pump has 300l/h capacity and currently pumps the fertilizer solution to the flood tray twice a day.

I sowed three types of chilies. Bolivian Rainbow(C. Annuum), Numex Twilight(C. Annuum) and Cabai Burung Ungu(C. Frutescens). Both of the annuums had 100% germination rate but neither of the frutescens seeds have germinated yet. They were under grow lights in about 27°C and high humidity and germinated in about two weeks.

After germination I moved the seedlings to rockwool and moved them to the ebb and flow system. They are under a 100w LED grow light with around 14 hours of light and two floods a day. They seem to grow quite well in this system.
