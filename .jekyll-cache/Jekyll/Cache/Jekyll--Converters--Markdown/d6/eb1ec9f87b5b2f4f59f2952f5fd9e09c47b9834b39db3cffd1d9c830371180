<h1 id="welcome-to-my-new-blog">Welcome to my new blog</h1>
<p>
I just created a new blog on my site to write about stuff that doesnâ€™t merit itâ€™s own page. Iâ€™ll probably start writing
about cooking, growing plants and programming or whatever my new hobby happens to be at the moment. 
</p>
<p>
The blog is still under construction so it will be a bit crude looking for a while. Iâ€™ll try to improve the look of 
the blog and add tags to filter posts by category.
